While cloning instances in ServiceNow, several tables are excluded by default to ensure security, protect sensitive data, and maintain environment integrity. These excluded tables typically include sys_user, sys_user_password, sys_email, syslog_transaction, sys_audit, sys_attachment, sys_email_canceled, syslog, and syslog_error. This ensures that user credentials, logs, and emails are not copied to non-production environments, preventing unauthorized access and preserving performance
