# Checks in this repository

## Category: Manageability

### Avoid using javascrip "document" object in Portal
Always avoid using native js "document" object for DOM manipulation in service portal. Instead we should use AngularJS equivalent capabilities to achieve the same.

### Don't use new Array()
In general, you should use the array literal notation when possible. It is easier to read, it gives the compiler a chance to optimize your code, and it's mostly faster too.

### Corrupt CI Relationships
CI Relationship records without a parent or a child record should not exist. Such CI Relationship records technically won't function. Situations like these are likely to occur due to incorrect manual System Administrative duties or incorrect automated processes.

### Scripts should not contain gs.log statements
The gs.log() statement can be used to write information to the system log. It is generally used when debugging. Using gs.log() statements will pollute the system log. Prior to promoting artifacts to a production instance, debugging statement should - in most cases - be removed.

### Scripts should not contain gs.info statements
The gs.info() statement can be used to write information to the system log. It is generally used when debugging. Using gs.info() statements will pollute the system log. Prior to promoting artifacts to a production instance, debugging statement should - in most cases - be removed.

### CMDB records with broken references
Reference fields are a stored reference to a field on another table. This creates a relationship between the two tables.

In some cases, the reference gets broken. Technically the field will still hold a value, though will display a blank value or a sys_id and the reference does not work anymore. The reference is incorrect or worse, the reference does not exist on the target table (also not under an other sys_id). This could occur due to scripting, scripting with hardcoded incorrect values, imported data with incorrect references (for example sys_ids to references might differ between instances when those records were newly created instead of being promoted between the instances).

### Many-to-many records with broken references
Reference fields are a stored reference to a field on another table. This creates a relationship between the two tables.

In some cases, the reference gets broken. Technically the field will still hold a value, though will display a blanc value or a sys_id and the reference does not work anymore. The reference is incorrect or worse, the reference does not exist on the target table (also not under an other sys_id). This could occur due to scripting, scripting with hardcoded incorrect values, imported data with incorrect references (for example sys_ids to references might differ between instances when those records were newly created instead of being promoted between the instances).

### Task records with broken references
Reference fields are a stored reference to a field on another table. This creates a relationship between the two tables.

In some cases, the reference gets broken. Technically the field will still hold a value, though will display a blanc value or a sys_id and the reference does not work anymore. The reference is incorrect or worse, the reference does not exist on the target table (also not under an other sys_id). This could occur due to scripting, scripting with hardcoded incorrect values, imported data with incorrect references (for example sys_ids to references might differ between instances when those records were newly created instead of being promoted between the instances).

### Consider using getXMLAnswer instead of getXML
getXMLAnswer only retrieves the Answer which we are actually after. getXML retrieves the whole XML document. In most cases, we are not interested in the whole XML document, though only in the Answer.
For the rare cases where you are interested in the whole XML document, simply mute the generated scan finding.

### Could not verify Remote instance connection
Connection test for the remote instance defined did not result in a positive response. 

### Duplicate Script Include Name
This uses a table check to find other Script Includes having the same API name. Technically this is possible, but causes issues as there is no way to control which Script Include will be instantiated when being called.

### Don't use new Array()
In general, you should use the array literal notation when possible. It is easier to read, it gives the compiler a chance to optimize your code, and it's mostly faster too.

### Don't use new Object()
In general, you should use the object literal notation when possible. It is easier to read, it gives the compiler a chance to optimize your code, and it's mostly faster too.

### High number of workflows running for a single record
In general, for a single record only a few Workflow context will be running. If a high number of Workflow context are active, this often indicates an issue on the starting conditions of your Workflow. More then 10 active Workflow context is considered being a high number. 

### Parent All Nodes/Active Nodes without childs
Schedule records with system ID "all Nodes" or "active nodes", are considered to be parent schedules. Parent schedules that themselves will never run but instead spawn child jobs (of the same name) for each application node required by their definition. Jobs with system ID "all nodes", are typically background maintenance jobs required for general node health and management. Jobs with system ID "active nodes", are typically jobs that need to run the same event processor or other jobs that need increased processing bandwidth across the platform.

### Product Catalog without Product Models
Catalog Items in the Product Catalog should be created from the underlying Product Model and this association should be kept intact.

### Scripts should not contain debugging statements in production
The "gs.log()", "gs.debug()", "console.log()", etc. statements can be used to write information to the system log, while the "gs.print()", etc. statements also sends it as output to the screen. It is generally used when debugging. Using "gs.log()", "gs.debug()", "console.log()", etc. statements on a production instance will pollute the system log, while it is never used as you do not perform debugging on a production instance.

### Unprocessed queues
External Communication Channel (ECC) Queue is a connection point between an instance and the MID Server. Jobs that the MID Server needs to perform are saved in this queue until the MID Server is ready to handle them. The default polling interval is set to 40 seconds. When there are unprocessed queue records, this can indicate a large volume of queue records, a processing issue in general, or a MID Server issue.

### Unprocessed schedules
Schedules with a state "Ready" run at the next scheduled interval (this does not include schedules with trigger type "Run at System Startup" and "On Demand"). When there are unprocessed schedules, this can indicate a large volume of schedules, a processing issue in general, or errors on the individual schedule itself.

### Do not use hard-coded sys_ids
Hard-coded sys_ids can lead to unpredictable results (sys_ids may differ between instances) and can be difficult to track down.

### Hard coded Instance URL
Hard coding instance URL is not a best practice as they reduce the usability of your code. The URL remains static and it does not change when you move the code to a different instance or it can get overwritten during clone backs. This can break the related functionalities or create unexpected results.

### Before Business rules should not insert() records in any tables
Before business rules execute before the data on current record is saved to database. In case, the before business rule fails or aborts its operation, then any insert operations within the business rule becomes invalid but it cannot be reverted back as the operation would have already been completed. In order to avoid such issues, before business rules should not include insert operations.

### Update set description should not be empty
Validates the description of the update sets created is not empty as it provides the release management team better understanding what's getting pushed.

### Update set should not have more than 1000 updates 
Update sets with more than 1000 configuration updates should be broken down into multiple update sets with batching or the parent story has to be more granular as reviewing update set configs and commiting/backing out may have issues.  

### Updates in wrong update set scope
The scope for Customer Update [sys_update_xml] records should match the scope of the Update Set in which the Customer Update resides. Having a mismatch may cause Update Sets to generate preview errors meaning you cannot commit them until the errors are resolved.

### Delete orphaned variables
Variables should be used in  Catalog Item or a Variable Set. Variables not in use should be deleted.

### Delete Orphaned Catalog Client Scripts
Catalog Client Script should be used in either a Catalog Item or a Variable Set. Catalog Client Scripts not in use should be deleted.

### Update set description should not be empty
Catalog UI policy should be used in either a Catalog Item or a Variable Set. Catalog UI Policies not in use should be deleted.

### Client Script Business rule or Script Include should not have an empty description or be without comments in the script section
Comments and description add extra information int he scripts and usally help in long run and during upgrades if an udate has been made so its a best practice to add comments and a description to these platform scripts. 

### Active groups without active users
Groups are commonly used in business process for approvals, and notifications. Avoiding groups that are empty, or contain only inactive users, can cause processes to halt or provide unexpected results.

### Valid Script Include Name - No Spaces
Script Includes names should not include spaces since it is not possible to call them if there is a space in the name.

### Roles assigned to non-existing users
Identify role assignments (sys_user_has_role) for users that do not exists

## Category: Upgradability

### Call GlideRecord using new
Good naming convention and self-descriptive code contain "new" to define GlideRecord. In some versions or for some parts of the Platform leaving "new" off will work, though for other parts of the Platform or after upgrades this can cause unexpected behavior.

### Incident table should not be extended
Check if the baseline restriction to extend the Incident table has been removed and at least one child table extending Incident has been created.

### Choice table should not be extended
Check if the Choice [sys_choice] table has been extended. This is not supported by ServiceNow.

### User table should not be extended
Check if the User [sys_user] table has been extended. This is not recommended and can cause problems when a user needs to be in more than one user table.

## Category: Performance

### getMessage() called in Client Script 
This is a simple table check to find client scripts with use the getMessage function but do not preload messages using the Messages field. As the check does a simple contains query it could produce false-positives if the getMessage is either commented or from another library.

### Glide-API in ACL
This will check ACL rules with operation READ for usage of Glide API calls, i.e. GlideRecord and GlideAggregate as these can cause significant performance impact. s the check does a simple contains query it could produce false-positives if the getMessage is either commented or from another library.

### Cache flushed as part of scripts
This is using some advanced linter check to find usages of gs.setProperty or gs.cacheFlush. Both functions will trigger a cache flush and thus cause performance impacts. 

### Global Business Rules
This is a simple table check to find Business Rules that are global. Global Business Rules have no condition or table restrictions and load on every page in the system. Most functions defined in global Business Rules are fairly specific, such as an advanced reference qualifier on one field of one form. There is no benefit to loading this kind of script on every page.

### Global Client Scripts 
This is a simple table check to find Client Scripts that are global. Global client scripts have no table restrictions; therefore they will load on every page in the system introducing browser load delay in the process.

### Using Synchronous AJAX calls in client script
Synchronous usage of AJAX calls (getXMLWait) pauses the browser interaction until data is retrieved from the server side and thereby reducing user experience. Using them in an onLoad or onChange client side scripts is not a best practice recommendation and can create performance issues for your users.

### Business Rule without any conditions
A business rule is triggered whenever a user opens a list or form view or when a user inserts/updates or deletes a record. Without any conditions added, it will always evaluate to true and triggerred at all times. This can add to the performance increasing server processing time and hence it is recommended to restrict business rule execution by either adding a condition or filter condition or a role condition and preventing its execution unless it is necessary.

### Business rules should not use current.update() 
Avoid using current.update() in a business rule script. The update() method triggers business rules to run on the same table for insert and update operations, leading to a business rule calling itself over and over. Changes made in before business rules are automatically saved when all before business rules are complete, and after business rules are best used for updating related, not current, objects

### Avoid Dot-Walking to the sys_id of a Reference Field
The value of a reference field is a sys_id. When you dot-walk to the sys_id, the system does an additional database query to retrieve the caller_id record, then retrieves the sys_id. This can lead to performance issues. 

### Do not use getRowCount() for fetching row count
Using getRowCount method of GlideRecord can cause performance issues while quering on tables with high record count. The method counts each row one by one to determine the total row count and hence more the number of rows, more time it would take to execute scripts that uses it.

### Query business rules should not use query() on GlideRecord
Query business rules that query themselves will continue to loop indefinitely until being caught by the platforms recursion limit. This can build up to an excessive response time and possibly cause the transaction to time out or create performance issues.

### Always deregister $rootScope.$on listeners on the scope $destory event
$rootScope.$on listeners will remain in memory if not properly cleaned up. This will create a memory leak if the controller falls out of scope.
```javascript
api.controller = function ($rootScope, $scope) {
  /* widget controller */
  var c = this;

  var deregister = $rootScope.$on("someevent", function () {});

  $scope.$on("$destroy", function destroyScope() {
    deregister();
  });
};
```

### Provide alternate value when fetching Glide property
Recommendation to provide alternate/default value when calling gs.getProperty() to avoid errors if the property is not set. 

### Running Business Rules on Transform Maps 
Running business rules during transform may cause the transform to take longer than expected, or cause the instance to slow down.Do not run items like business rules, workflows, approval engines, and so on during a transform unless you want all insert and update business rules, notifications, and workflows to run

### Avoid using getReference()
getReference is no longer considered best practice due to its performance impact and it is recommended to use g_scratchpad or GlideAjax instead.


## Category: Security
##Check Mandatory fields on incident
This check is used to find mandatory fields on incident

### Avoid using setBasicAuth for REST messages
It is possible to script REST messages directly. When doing so, using the .setBasicAuth method is considered a security risk. Doing so, the username and password are entered - unprotected - in server side scripting.

### Tables without ACLs
This check searches for any custom table if there exists at least one ACL record. If not a finding is raised.

### Scripted REST API without Authentication
Scripted REST APIs should be not be public but enforce  access controls and require additional access to data. 

### Avoid the eval function
Improper use of eval() opens up your code for injection attacks and difficulties with debugging.

### Do not use gr as a variable name
The platform is Javascript and a lot of code is run in a global variable scope. A "gr" defined in one business rule can clobber another "gr" defined in some other script.

### Admins not logged in for 1 month
Monitor users with role `admin` (not locked out) that are not logged for longer than 1 month

### Users left in already inactivated Groups
After deactivation of Groups there can be still some users.
Group offer membership but also can provide some roles that after deactivation should be considered as no longer needed.

### Report with public role can expose data to unauthenticated clients
For table that store reports definition there is also posibility to assign roles. It is possible that by default it is added `public` role. It means that even not authorized clients can access such report and sometimes with exposed data that shouldn't be accessible.

### Scheduled Job with RunAs set as Locked Out user
Detecting no longer active user with flag Locked Out set to true that is set as a RunAs for Scheduled Job

### Client Scripts should not use GlideRecord() API
Verify that instance doesn't have GlideRecord() usage in client scripts and instead make use of GlideAjax.

### Inactive users should be also locked out
If the user is deactivated he should also be locked out otherwise he could still be able to use Table API.

## Employee files should not be cloned over to sub production instances.
Verify that clone exclude table configuration on production contains configuration for sn_hr_ef_employee_document table.

### Workflow context table has an active record for more than 6 months
If the number of records grows in the Workflow context table, it may slow down the execution of the other contexts as they may consume a lot of DB space which will impact your overall instance performance as well. Active workflows are not deleted by system jobs which cleanup hence we need this instance scan check. 

### Flow context table has an active record for more than 6 months
Review the flow contexts that are in waiting, in progress or queued state and running for more than 6 months might hinder the overall platform, hence regular checks needs to be done on these flows. In progress, queued or waiting flow contexts are not deleted by system jobs which cleanup hence we need this instance scan check. 

### Active users with past employment end date
Review the users whose employement end date is in the past and the user is still active, this is a potential threat to the security of the platform. 

### Set glide.invalid_query.returns_no_rows to true
The "glide.invalid_query.returns_no_rows" property provides a safeguard against queries running which could return unintended data which could then be deleted, manipulated or used incorrectly. It is recommended to have this property exist and be set to true. When this property does not exist an invalid query will return all rows. 

### Use GlideRecordSecure instead of GlideRecord API for Client Callable Script Include
Use GlideRecordSecure API to ensure the security checks are performed and unauthorized access of data is prevented as it will automatically enforce ACLs.

## Category: User Experience

### Added a Number Prefix which already exists
Creating new number records does not require uniqueness. Though having duplicate number records causes some ServiceNow core functionality not to behave as expected. For example, the search might return a record from another table the number prefix is also used on.

## List Inactive users from active group 
List inactive users that still belongs to activate groups

### HTTP connection records not excluded on clones from Prod

When cloned, records from http_connection table which is extended from sys_connection table is orphaned or cannot be viewed. Even though clone is excluding and preserving sys_connection but not any data on http_connection and hence clone leaves the orphan record on the table sys_connection and this creates issues to view, delete those records. Login to the production instance and check to see if the http_connection table is excluded in the exclude tables module under System Clones.
Note: It was suggested by ServiceNow support to add table "http_connection" in clone excluder and preserver for one the cases as i faced an similar issue.

### Avoid using alert() in client scripts
It is recommended to use an OOB library for modals in order to improve the user experience instead of alert().
